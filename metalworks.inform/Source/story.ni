[//////////START METAL BUCKET//////////]

The metal bucket is a room. The description is "You are literally standing on the rim of a huge flaming metal bucket. I hope you feel good about yourself, for this is the day that you show your boss that you can be whoever you want to be, albeit with your shoes melting and on fire. Seriously though, you probably shouldn't stand up here for too much longer if you don't want your metalworking gear to fail. Luckily, the crane seems to be moving your bucket nearer to the big window. Now, the rest of your escape goes according to simple physics.".

The dumpster is a room. "A wonderful dumpster. It looks like you successfully made it out of the steel mill without letting your boss talk to you."

The rat is a thing in the dumpster. "Oh look, a rat.". The description is "A rat. He seems pretty content with you sitting there. He probably wouldn't mind to much if you picked him up actually."

Understand "pick up [something]" as taking. [this is somehow not a default synonym in inform]

After taking rat:
	say "'Squeak'" instead.;
		Move rat to player.
	
Use no scoring.

An every turn rule:
if the player is carrying the rat,
end the game in victory.
