An Interactive Fiction by Ty Suthard

Janitor&apos;s Closet
A Janitor&apos;s closet, just roomy enough for a body to pass out comfortably in. In the corner is the usual mop, there are some crumpled papers scattered around, and there&apos;s a large shelf with what looks like lots of cleaning supplies. To your south you can see a door.

You can see a Door to the Janitor&apos;s Closet and a Mop here.

(first taking the Janitor&apos;s Key)
[(1) taking the Janitor&apos;s Key - silently]
It&apos;s actually a bit strange that it&apos;s in here, you figured sooner or later you would have to resort to kicking down the door, which you probably could have managed, you just chose to take the less aggressive course of action, which is fine, I suppose. I mean, it&apos;s certainly not as spectacular as kicking down a door, but it worked for you.

A Janitor&apos;s closet, just roomy enough for a body to pass out comfortably in. In the corner is the usual mop, there are some crumpled papers scattered around, and there&apos;s a large shelf with what looks like lots of cleaning supplies. To your south you can see a door.

You can see a Door to the Janitor&apos;s Closet Door and a Mop here.
