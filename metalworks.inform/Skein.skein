Janitor&apos;s Closet
A Janitor&apos;s closet, just roomy enough for a body to pass out comfortably in. In the corner is the usual mop, there are some crumpled papers scattered around, and there&apos;s a large shelf with what looks like lots of cleaning supplies. To your south you can see a door.

Gear Room
This gear room would be a lot like a locker room if there were any lockers. You can see a red button in the corner of the room next to a large steel door, and some metalworking clothes in another corner. There&apos;s a sign to the south next to the steel door.

A heavy, sold steel door. Unlike the door for the janitor&apos;s closet, there&apos;s no way you&apos;ll be able to kick this one down.

You can also see a button here.
