You wake up in a Janitor&apos;s closet after what you assume was a really long night. Not that you can remember it at all. You can barely remember anything, actually. All you know is that you work in a steelmill and that you want to quit your job in style.

Janitor&apos;s Closet
A Janitor&apos;s closet, just roomy enough for a body to pass out comfortably in. In the corner is the usual mop, there are some crumpled papers scattered around, and there&apos;s a large shelf with what looks like lots of cleaning supplies. To your south you can see a door.

This gear room would be a lot like a locker room if there were any lockers. You can see a red button in the corner of the room next to a large steel door, and some metalworking clothes in another corner. There&apos;s a sign to the south next to the steel door.

A heavy, solid steel door. Unlike the door for the janitor&apos;s closet, there&apos;s no way you&apos;ll be able to kick this one down.
