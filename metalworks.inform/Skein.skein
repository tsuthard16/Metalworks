You wake up in a Janitor&apos;s closet after what you assume was a really long night. Not that you can remember it at all. You can barely remember anything, actually. All you know is that you work in a steelmill and that you want to quit your job in style.

Janitor&apos;s Closet
A Janitor&apos;s closet, just roomy enough for a body to pass out comfortably in. In the corner is the usual mop, there are some crumpled papers scattered around, and there&apos;s a large shelf with what looks like lots of cleaning supplies. To your south you can see a door.

metal bucket
You are literally standing on the rim of a huge flaming metal bucket. I hope you feel good about yourself, for this is the day that you show your boss that you can be whoever you want to be, albeit with your shoes melting and on fire. Seriously though, you probably shouldn&apos;t stand up here for too much longer if you don&apos;t want your metalworking gear to fail.
